# Ionic 3 Tutorial

## Part 0: Introduction to Ionic

Ionic is a free and open source framework used to build progressive web and native mobile applications.
The framework empowers web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web with a single code base.

A powerful command-line-interface (CLI) coupled with a pre-built UI kit, 120+ native APIs, and a strong developer community makes building applications with Ionic a breeze.

Ionic is powered by Google's popular **Angular** framework and Microsoft's **TypeScript** superset of Javascript. This tutorial assumes that you have at least a bit of prior experience with these technologies. Use the following resources to familiarize yourself:

### Angular Resources

* [Official Documentation](https://angular.io/docs)
* [60 Minute Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhzGSHNhnbI&t=54s)
* [Angular-SF MeetUp (Bay Area)](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-SF/)

**Please Note:** When studying Angular, be sure to read up on Angular 2.0+. Angular 1.x is an entirely different framework that utilizes an MVC-based architecture instead of an (oftentimes considered more scalable) component-based architecture.

### TypeScript Resources
